fox
===

fox is a set of tools and utilities for building iOS and Mac projects.
fox is not a normal project, but rather an outlet for my deep
frustrations with Apple’s Xcode tools. The vision for fox to provide a
complete replacement for the Xcode build and project file system (but
*not* an IDE or text editor.) I realize that achieving this vision is
probably impossible, but I believe I’ll get something positive out of
the journey.

**fox is very early and not recommended for production use yet.**
